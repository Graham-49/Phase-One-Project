 **Aviation Risk Assessment: Data-Driven Recommendations for Aircraft Purchases**
 **Overview**

This project focuses on evaluating the risks associated with different aircraft makes and models as part of a company’s planned entry into the aviation industry. Using accident and incident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) (1962–2023), the analysis identifies patterns, recurring safety concerns, and performance trends across aircraft types.

The goal is to provide a data-driven foundation for making informed decisions on which aircraft to purchase for commercial and private operations. By understanding historical safety records, the company can minimize risk exposure and strengthen its market entry strategy.

 **Business Understanding**

The company plans to expand into the aviation sector but currently lacks insights into the safety profiles of aircraft models.

**Stakeholders**

Executive Leadership: responsible for investment decisions.

Operations & Fleet Managers: require guidance on safe and reliable aircraft.

Safety & Compliance Teams: ensure adherence to aviation safety standards.

**Key Business Questions**

Which aircraft models have historically demonstrated low accident rates?

What patterns or causes are most commonly associated with aviation risks?

How do different categories of aircraft (commercial vs. private) compare in terms of safety and reliability?

 **Data Understanding and Analysis**
Source of Data

Dataset: Civil aviation accidents and selected incidents

Provider: National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)

Timeframe: 1962–2023

Scope: Includes accidents/incidents in the United States and international waters

**Description of Data**

The dataset includes:

Aircraft details (make, model, purpose of flight)

Accident details (date, location, weather, phase of flight)

Human factors (pilot experience, error involvement)

Outcomes (injuries, fatalities, damage level)

Each record represents a single aviation accident/incident event.



 **Conclusion**
**Summary of Findings**

From the analysis of 60+ years of aviation accident data:

Private and personal flights account for the largest proportion of aviation accidents compared to commercial operations.

Accident frequency has declined significantly over the decades, reflecting industry-wide safety improvements.

Certain aircraft manufacturers and models consistently appear in higher accident counts, highlighting elevated risk factors for those fleets.

**Recommendations**

Prioritize aircraft with strong long-term safety records

Focus purchases on manufacturers/models that show consistently lower accident involvement.

Avoid older or historically problematic models even if acquisition costs are low.

Invest in safety-focused pilot training

Since pilot error is a recurring factor, strengthening pilot training and certification processes will reduce risk exposure, especially for private operations.

Leverage modern aircraft with advanced safety systems

Newer models often integrate technology that reduces accident probability (e.g., collision avoidance, advanced autopilot).

Acquiring these can balance upfront cost with reduced long-term risk.
